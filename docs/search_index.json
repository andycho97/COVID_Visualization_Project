In the United States, the first case was found in Snohomish, Washington on January 21, 2020. It was not until March that the federal government officially declared a state of emergency and the cases started to rise exponentially. Against the optimistic belief that COVID-19 cases will reduce significantly in the summer, the number of cases in the United States showed a modest decrease in late spring, followed by a second wave in the summer, and a third wave in late 2020. Our group wanted to further explore the COVID-19 patterns in the United States, specifically on the state level. Different states had vastly differeing approaches to the pandemic and we were curious to answer these questions: What are some major COVID-19 patterns (cases and deaths) in the US, in relation to major domestic events? What are some major COVID-19 Patterns (cases and deaths) when stratified by states/regions, and if necessary, specific counties of the state? What are some patterns that can signal a major upcoming wave? (e.g. if we see a steady growth in cases/deaths for x consecutive days, does that tell us a bigger picture about the state of COVID-19 in the US or a specific state?) We came up with visualizations that help answer the questions above. Explore each sections on the left-hand side of your screen! "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The COVID Tracking Project While studying the patterns in COVID-19 cases in the United States, we recently learned about the COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/) at the Atlantic. The data API page has historical COVID-19 data on the national level (https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/us/daily.csv) and state level (https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.csv). The data is also available in json format, but we opted to use the CSV format. The national level data has the date on a daily basis, the number of current and cumulative test results, number of current and cumulative hospitalized people, the number of current and cumulative people on ventilators, the number of recovered people, and the number of deaths for each day. The state level data has similar information, but for each state. However, certain rows such as antibody test results are not available for every state, so we will proceed with columns mentioned above, which are available for all states. Furthermore, we will research throughout the project to gather the current events data for the United States in 2020. These data points will be used in the visualizations as key dates that could have sparked an increase in the COVID-19 cases (e.g. Easter, Memorial Day, Protests, Election). Lastly, we found the population for each state on https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us and will use this information when dividing the number of cases/tests/deaths for each state by the state population to demonstrate the patterns on per capita basis. The population numbers on this project are updated until December 15, 2020. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data comes for the most part in a format that is ready to make visualizations and perform exploratory data analysis. We will transform some variables into factor variables and create new grouping variables based on the continuous variables. For example, we will segment states based on positive tests and deaths into “high”, “med”, “low”. We will then create factors out of these variables. Most of the variables are already in a usable format and require little transformation. We will also create variables for day and month by feature engineering from the date variable, which will allow us to visualize daily and monthly trends. When plotting the COVID-19 patterns on the state-level, the data sometimes has a weekly pattern (cases and deaths are lower during weekends compared to weekdays) for certain states. In order to control for the weekly pattern, we will use the rollmean function from the zoo library for the 7-Day average. This is a standard practice used in other COVID-19 databases. For comparing the spread of COVID-19 across different states, we will also present graphs on per capita basis (e.g. there are fewer cases in Illinois than California, but there are much fewer people in Illinois, so it is suffering more from the virus on average). When there are visibly under-reported numbers, we will remove those data points to not output misleading results. For example, the COVID-19 test numbers were below 1,000 in New Jersey until March 23, 2020, and suddenly increased to 9,000 on March 24. In this case, it was not appropriate to include test data before March 24 for New Jersey. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values For the state-level dataset, some rows are missing no data and some rows are missing significant amount of data. Fortunately, the crucial columns, including date, state, totalTestResults, positiveIncrease (in COVID-19 cases), negativeIncrease (in COVID-19 cases), totalTestResultsIncrease, deathIncrease, and hospitalizedIncrease, do not have any missing rows. On the other hand, many of the columns related to hospitalization are ventilators have consistent missingness in data (e.g. hospitalizedCurrently, inlcuCurrently). Furthermore, the detailed columns regarding PCR tests, such as totalTestsPeopleViral (unique people tested at least once via PCR testing) and positiveTestsViral (completed PCR tests (or specimens tested) that return positive) are consistently missing. In order to have the most consistent and fully available column for testing, we will perform our analyses and visualizations using totalTestResultsIncrease for each state. Also note that below graphs are missing columns regarding Antibody and Antiget tests as those columns are unrelated to the scope of this project. In our analyses and visualizations, we will focus on certain states that are leading in COVID-19 cases and representing different parts of the country. We can see from the below graphs that data for certain columns are often fully available or fully missing. To avoid any potential inconsistencies, we will proceed with columns mentioned above that are universally fully available for all states. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overall Patterns 5.2 Patterns by Region 5.3 Correlation with COVID-19 Test Numbers?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overall Patterns We started by looking at how United States was doing as a whole to get an idea of the bigger picture effects of COVID-19 among all states. Below is a quick snapshot of how the states were performing. As the data suggests almost every state is exhibiting an exponential trend in daily new positive tests reaching its all time highs within the last month with a few exceptions like Hawaii, Iowa, and North Dakota. As we will discuss later in the results, this dramatic increase can be attributed to many factors such as higher testing rate, holidays, lax in public cautiousness, and increased travel. Indeed the data trends prove alarming and depict a drastic shift in COVID-19’s impact on American lives. We may and have already seen changes in public policy across states. For example, New York has reverted some of the allowances of public interaction like indoor dining. California as well has issued shelter at home laws. COVID-19 Patterns in All States 5.2 Patterns by Region Now that we quantitatively established that the country as a whole has greatly been affected by COVID-19, we will focus more on the individual state-level trends. When we plot the number of confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 in each state, we can easily see that the top states in the “high” category are California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and New York. We quickly note that these states represent different parts of the US - West Coast, South, Southeast, Midwest, and East Coast, and COVID was widespread throughout the country. A few different patterns could be seen from these states. California and Texas had their COVID-19 cases mildly increase in the spring, and had their first big wave in July. They had their second big wave near the end of the year. Florida had a similar pattern as California and Texas, except they had a visible first peak in March. On the other hand, Illinois and New York had completely patterns. Illinois was able to bend the curve when it was peaking in May, and did not sharply increase until November. New York was hit the hardest in March and significantly brought down the curve in the following months. Their second wave came in November/December and it was as big as their first wave. The pink vertical lines in the graph represents days with major events in the United States - Easter, Memorial Day, Start of Protests against Police Brutality, Independence Day, Election Day, and Thanksgiving Day, respectively. From the above plots, we may think the following may have happened in the United States: New York (as well as New Jersey - included as another representation of the Greater NY Area) was a special case in that the spread started earlier in the year and it was able to significantly decrease the infection rate while other parts of the country suffered a huge increase in the summer The spike in the rest of the United States (West Coast, South, Southeast) started around Memorial Day weekend, when families were gathering for the long weekend The Memorial Day weekend increase was exacerbated by the protests against police brutality when people gathered onto the streets all across the country The number of cases decreased in the beginning of the fall (both absolute and per capita), but started to increase again in October All regions, including New York and New Jersey this time, started to see a huge spike in November with the Election (rallies took place) and the Thanksgiving weekend (mostly visible in California) However, in order to validate these assumptions (that many Americans have today), we will perform a check - how was the testing done? Specifically, did the number tests stay consistent? The positivity rate seemed to stay below 0.20 for all areas. See the plots below: 5.3 Correlation with COVID-19 Test Numbers? With the exception of New York and New Jersey, we can see that number of cases mirror the number of tests in each state. Florida is a good example of the decrease in tests. In July, the number of tests started to decline from 90,000 to 50,000 by fall. When the number of tests decreased by half, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased by a quarter from 12,000 to 3,000. When Florida started to increase the tests back to above 100,000 per day, the number of cases spiked back up to 9,000. We acknowledge the correlation between the number of tests and the number of positive cases in many parts of the country, and note that the “decrease” in cases between the summer and the fall may be due to reduced testing. The pattern for the entire country may be similar to that of Illinois where the number of positive cases consistently increased from June/July when many states started to loosen up the social distancing rules, and exploded starting in October, which could have multiple reasons including the whether, election, and simply people growing tired after months of social distancing.

Throughout this project we aimed to answer a few key questions and discovered some more interesting problems in the process. Below is a refresher of those questions and our conclusions from our results: 7.1 Initial Questions What are some major COVID-19 patterns (cases and deaths) in the US, in relation to major domestic events? In our analysis we noticed some alarming patterns and confirmed our suspicions that major holidays seemed to have an effect on the increasing the spread of COVID-19. The majority of states saw a rise of positive cases following Memorial Day weekend. In addition, we saw significant upticks following the protests against police brutality and Thanksgiving. However, this only paints one side of the story. Further analysis showed that positive cases were visibly correlated with the number of tests. This result, in fact, shows that the rise due to holidays seems to be just blips in the grand scheme of COVID-19 spread in the US. Moreover, it seems like we are hitting the exponential rise portion of the pandemics growth. As discussed earlier, the United States has had an upward trend until October, followed by an exponential increase similar to that of Illinois. Almost every state regardless of their performance in the summer months has exploded exponentially in the last two months. Below is the national trend with 7-day average: What are some major COVID-19 Patterns (cases and deaths) when stratified by states/regions, and if necessary, specific counties of the state? We stratified states based on the magnitude of tests and relative to their population and found that the “high” states, although usually performing worse in number of cases, did not trend that differently from “medium”, and “low” states. This observation confirms the final result from our previous question that regardless of seasonality, holidays, or individual state performance, the US is heading towards the and exponential trend in terms of spread of COVID-19. What are some patterns that can signal a major upcoming wave? (e.g. if we see a steady growth in cases/deaths for x consecutive days, does that tell us a bigger picture about the state of COVID-19 in the US or a specific state?) We found certain patterns within the data of rise and falls, but could not conclusively discern a reason for the trends. Some of the trends were due to data reporting issues and when we smoothed out for the trends by taking the 7-day average, some of those disappeared. Again, we initially hypothesized that major events in the United States led to increases to COVID-19, although true in its locality, does not detract from the exponential growth we are seeing today. 7.2 Additional Insight In our work we also tried to attribute local policy changes in regards to COVID-19. Laws were extremely strict initially in March. As the hysteria died, people across the US began to lax their weariness in regards to danger and spread of COVID-19. This can also be reflected in local laws. Phased approaches of openings were announced and laws began to relax across the board. Potentially, the initial fear and stronger laws could have led to the steadiness of the summer spread. However, the relaxed laws and the normalization of COVID-19 in our lives have led to a surge in cases, which we see today. Below is an example of NY law changes overtime. The laxing of restrictions in the summer months are clearly reflected in the timeline (‘https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_(state)’): Date Action Taken March 7, 2020 State of emergency declared.

Pfizer has been approved for distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine and expects to have 50 million doses available by the end of 2020. This is a great news and can potentially influence the trend. At the same time, we understand that widespread distribution and adoption are still slow processes. With this in mind, the exponential trend will still continue for the foreseeable future. Once the vaccine becomes more accessible to the everyday person, we can then monitor the trends and see how effective the vaccine are. As is the case with new drugs, the effectiveness is still yet to be determined. 7.4 Final Words In concluding our project, we hope that you gained a better understanding of the spread of COVID-19 and urgency of the situation. Given the exponential growth in the recent months, we can see the effects of our behaviors and our local laws have consequences months later. We hope that you came away more informed about the situation. "]]
